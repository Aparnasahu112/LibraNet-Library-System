# ðŸ“š LibraNet â€” Simple Library System in C++

This is a small C++ project that demonstrates *basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)* concepts like classes and inheritance.  
It simulates a very simple library system where you can borrow and return books, magazines, and other items.

- Base class *LibraryItem* with common details (title, author, availability).
- Derived classes:
  - *Book* (e.g., Attack on Titan adapted from manga)
  - *Novel* (e.g., The Kite Runner)
  - *Magazine* (e.g., TIME Magazine)
  - *Manga* (e.g., Demon Slayer)
